  <h1>Kruthika ❤️</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🌸 You’re Not Just a Girl in My Grade</h2>
    <p>You’re the reason I look forward to school. The reason I sit quietly in class, hoping for one moment where our eyes meet. You’re not just someone I like—you’re someone I admire deeply. You’re the calm in my chaos, the light in my day, and the thought that never leaves my mind.</p>
    <p>You make everything feel softer. You walk into a room and suddenly it feels like the world has color again. You laugh, and it echoes in my head for hours. You speak, and I listen—even when I pretend not to. You’re not just a girl I like. You’re the girl I wish I had the courage to talk to.</p>
    <p class="quote">"You’re the part of my day I never want to miss."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🧑‍💻 I’m Vybhoohith</h2>
    <p>I’m 13. I code. I build secret diaries, games, and quiet corners of the internet where I can say what I’m too shy to speak. I’m not loud. I’m not bold. But I feel things deeply. And every time I write a line of HTML, it’s because I’m thinking of you.</p>
    <p>I’m the boy who sits in the back, who watches you smile and wonders what it would be like to make you laugh. I’m the boy who rewrites his notes just in case you borrow them. I’m the boy who built a digital diary just to store the feelings he’s too scared to say out loud.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I write code to express what my voice can’t say."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>💬 What I See in You</h2>
    <p>You’re kind without trying. You’re graceful without knowing. You make the world feel lighter just by being in it. I notice the way you laugh, the way you help others, the way you walk with quiet confidence. You’re not just beautiful—you’re unforgettable. And I wish I could tell you that without freezing up.</p>
    <p>You’re the kind of person who makes people feel safe. You don’t even realize how much light you carry. You’re the kind of girl who deserves poetry, not just compliments. You’re the kind of girl who makes someone believe in love—even if they’ve never said the word out loud.</p>
    <p class="quote">"You’re the kind of person who stays in someone’s heart forever."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>💖 What I Feel</h2>
    <p>I like you, Kruthika. Not in a silly way. Not in a passing way. In a real, gentle, honest way. I care about you. I think about you. I write about you. You’ve become the reason I try harder, dream bigger, and smile more. You’re the quiet inspiration behind everything I create.</p>
    <p>I don’t want to rush anything. I don’t want to make things awkward. I just want you to know that you mean something to me. That you’ve made my world brighter, even if you don’t know it. That you’ve made me feel something I didn’t know I could feel.</p>
    <p class="quote">"You’re the girl I think about when I write love into code."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>📝 Why I Wrote This</h2>
    <p>Because I’m not brave enough to say it out loud. Because I wanted you to know, even if you never see this. Because you deserve to be admired, gently and truly, by someone who sees you for who you are. You’ve made my world brighter, and I just wanted to say thank you—for being you.</p>
    <p>Because I needed a place to say what I feel. Because I wanted to write something that lasts. Because even if this page stays hidden forever, it’s real. It’s mine. It’s yours. It’s love, written in HTML.</p>
    <p class="quote">"This page is my heart, hidden in code."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🌠 If You Ever Read This</h2>
    <p>I hope it makes you smile. I hope you feel seen. I hope you know that someone out there thinks you’re amazing—not because of how you look, but because of how you make people feel. You’ve made me feel something I didn’t know I could. And even if you never feel the same, I’ll always be grateful for you.</p>
    <p>I hope you know that you’re loved. Quietly. Sincerely. By a boy who codes with you in mind. By someone who believes in you, even from a distance. By someone who hopes, one day, you’ll understand how much you mean to him.</p>
    <p class="quote">"You’re the reason I believe quiet love can be powerful."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="footer">
    Kruthika, this isn’t just a page. It’s a feeling. A hope. A quiet truth. You are loved—truly, deeply, and sincerely—by a boy named Vybhoohith, who writes his heart into every line of code.
