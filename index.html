    <h2>🌸 The Girl From 9A</h2>
    <p>You’re not in my section. You’re in 9A, and I’m in 9B. But somehow, you’re always in my thoughts. I see you in the hallway, during breaks, maybe just for a few seconds—but those seconds stay with me all day.</p>
    <p>You’re not just a girl in another class. You’re the reason I look up when I hear laughter. The reason I walk slower past your door. The reason I write pages of code hoping one day you’ll read them.</p>
    <p class="quote">"Even if we’re in different sections, you’re always close in my heart."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🧑‍💻 I’m Vybhoohith</h2>
    <p>I’m 13. I’m in 9B. I code because it’s the only way I know how to say what I feel. I build secret diaries, games, and quiet pages like this one—where I can write about you without fear.</p>
    <p>I’m not brave in person. I freeze up when you’re near. But behind a screen, I can be honest. I can say that I like you. That I admire you. That I think you’re amazing in ways you probably don’t even realize.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I’m just a boy in 9B, quietly loving a girl from 9A."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>💬 What I See in You</h2>
    <pYou’re kind, graceful, and quietly strong. You make people feel safe. You make the day feel lighter. You walk with a calm that I wish I had. You laugh like the world is still good. And you make me believe it is.</p>
    <p>You’re not just beautiful—you’re unforgettable. You’re the kind of person who leaves a mark without even trying. And I notice it all, even if I never say a word.</p>
    <p class="quote">"You’re the kind of girl who turns ordinary days into something worth remembering."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>💖 What I Feel</h2>
    <p>I like you, Kruthika. Not just a little. Not just for a moment. I like you in a way that’s quiet, sincere, and real. I care about you. I think about you. I write about you. You’ve become the reason I smile more, dream bigger, and hope harder.</p>
    <p>I don’t expect anything. I just want you to know that you matter to someone. That someone is me. A boy who codes with you in mind. A boy who sees you from across the hallway and feels his heart race.</p>
    <p class="quote">"You’re the reason I believe love doesn’t need words—it just needs truth."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>📝 Why I Wrote This</h2>
    <p>Because I’m not brave enough to say it out loud. Because I wanted you to know, even if you never see this. Because you deserve to be admired, gently and truly, by someone who sees you for who you are.</p>
    <p>This page is my heart. It’s everything I’ve felt but never said. It’s the story of a boy in 9B who quietly loves a girl in 9A. And even if it stays hidden forever, it’s real. It’s yours.</p>
    <p class="quote">"This isn’t just HTML. It’s how I feel about you."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🌠 If You Ever Read This</h2>
    <pI hope it makes you smile. I hope you feel seen. I hope you know that someone out there thinks you’re amazing—not because of how you look, but because of how you make people feel.</p>
    <pYou’ve made me feel something I didn’t know I could. And even if you never feel the same, I’ll always be grateful for you. You’ve made my world brighter, just by being in it.</p>
    <p class="quote">"You’re the reason I believe quiet love can be powerful."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="footer">
    Kruthika, this isn’t just a page. It’s a feeling. A hope. A quiet truth. You are loved—truly, deeply, and sincerely—by a boy named Vybhoohith, who writes his heart into every line of code.
